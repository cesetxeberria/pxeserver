#DNS aren't configured in our ubuntu live system, I don't know why.
#This task fixes ubuntu's network configuration in 4 different ways.
---
#1st solution
#Install network manager and configure netplan to use it. This fixes everything.
- name: Install network-manager.
  apt:
    name: "{{ packages }}"
    install_recommends: no
  vars:
    packages:
    - network-manager

- name: Let NetworkManager manage all devices on this system. Ubuntu.
  copy:
    src: "{{ role_path }}/files/etc/netplan/001-network-manager-all.yaml"
    dest: "/etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml"
    mode: 0644

#2nd solution
#this fixes live systems but fails on installed systems
#- name: Configure ubuntu network with systemd
#  copy:
#    src: "{{ role_path }}/files/etc/systemd/network/10-eth0.network"
#    dest: "/etc/systemd/network/10-eth0.network"
#    mode: 0600

#3rd solution
#this fixes installed systems but fails on live systems
#- name: Configure ubuntu network with netplan
#  copy:
#    src: "{{ role_path }}/files/etc/netplan/001-default.yaml"
#    dest: "/etc/netplan/001-default.yaml"
#    mode: 0600

#4th solution
#this fixes live and installed systems but I prefer to use network-manager
#- name: Disable DNSStubListener.
#  replace:
#    dest: "/etc/systemd/resolved.conf"
#    regexp: "#DNSStubListener=yes"
#    replace: "DNSStubListener=no"
